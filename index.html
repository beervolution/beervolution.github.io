                                    The beer industry is a vital engine of the economy as it helps with job creation. It is estimated that for every job at a brewer, 29 additional jobs are supported down or upstream and another 10 more through induced consumer spending channel. In fact, 1 in every 110 jobs in the world is linked through direct, indirect, or induced impact channels to the beer sector from farming, delivery to retail and on-premise sales, supporting a total of 23 million jobs.

                                    With over 50 billion gallons of beer consumed each year, the total economic impact from the beer sector alone amounts to $555 billion of gross value added to the global GDP.

However, due to the pandemic, the beer industry was severely impacted with reports suggesting an estimated decline of 12% in large brewers’ revenues. However, improvements can be seen in 2021 as the numbers went down.

                                    Beer canning was introduced in 1935 which changed the industry and the way we consume beer today in contrast to the olden days of old oak barrels and bottled beer. The process of canning beer is a 7-step process that once required significant investment and manpower. However, technological advancements through the use of computing and AI has increased the efficiency of this process with greater focus on expelling the air from the can through the use of Nitrogen canning.

                            We examine the implications of beer, not just on the consumer, but also on the producer. We realise the health risks of beer consumption, but we also note the ease and affordability of procuring a beer due to the lowered costs of production from the effects of competition within the industry. 
                            <br><br>
                            The application of beer in our society cannot be discounted as well. Our lives are, seemingly, intertwined with beer in so many different ways that we might not even have noticed. 
                            <br><br>
                            Impacts of beer on all forms of life. Social, economic, and technological. In all fairness, beer brings about not only the negative effects that we tend to associate with, but definitely economical and technological effects too. It is unfair to generalise the negative effects of beer as consumption and tolerance of individuals varies, leading to different magnitudes of impact as well. We do not wish to fall into the idea of false dichotomy. 
                            <br><br>
                            We bring back the point of the individual’s responsibility of the consumption of beer. As one would understand, from our page, the various negative, positive, or neutral impacts, implications and applications of beer, that beer has definitely seeped deep into our lives. It is up to the individual to see to it, the scale of consumption, to behave responsibly as proper human beings.
