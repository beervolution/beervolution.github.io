			<h1 style="text-align:center;">Implication</h1>
			<h2 style="margin-left:5%; text-align:left;">1) Health implication</h2>
			<p style="margin:0 5% 5% 5%; text-align: justify;">
			Beer can cause weight gain and obesity which is the root of many other health issues. Excessive beer consumption can result in higher risk of heart disease, liver disease, and alcohol addiction. 
			
			Consumers are also becoming increasingly involved in learning about the origin or source of raw materials and the ethical footprint and long-term sustainability of the products they buy.
			For example, consumers can use blockchain technology to track the origins of their beer's barley, including where it was produced, harvested, and malted. Scanning a QR code on a beer pack gives you an end-to-end glimpse of the supply chain. 
			The blockchain brewery software provides a decentralized platform for improving traceability and gaining vital data on raw materials.
			</p>
			
			<h2 style="margin-left:5%; text-align:left;">2) Increased competition among breweries</h2>
			<p style="margin:0 5% 5% 5%; text-align: justify;">Breweries are beginning to use AI to improve their beer production such as customisation of alcohol content, flavor, colour, aroma and making product development more viable and faster. In order to stay competitive, breweries must focus on renewing their efficiency to protect their margins and maximise their resources. Breweries need to adapt by discovering new ways to train workers, make sales decisions and increase efficiency through technology, in order to survive and thrive in a evolving beer industry. Increasing competition in a shrinking beer market has forced the brewer to
				be cost effective. Technological innovations are used now to increase the
				productivity, to save energy or to create new products.
				
				There will probably always be a market for the small, traditional brewer.
				The larger brewing groups, however, need to follow closely technological
				changes. Successful incorporation of the technological innovations in the
				brewing process will largely determine the strength and the competitiveness
				of the brewery in the future

								<p>Alcohol use on high school students quality of learning</p>
								<p>Do you know that 1 in 4 youths between the ages of 12 and 20 drunk alcohol on a monthly basis? A similar proportion of 12th graders consumes 5 or more drinks in a row once every 2 weeks at the very least.

									A study has shown that alcohol has an effect on high school students’ quality of learning. An increase in alcohol consumption resulted in a small and yet statistically significant reduction in the GPA of male students and a statistically non-significant change in the GPA of female students. Instead, a higher level of drinking would result in more self-reported academic difficulties for female students. 
									
									Another study had beer chosen as a teaching tool to maximise students’ class participation and also systemise and enhance their knowledge of chemistry. Viewing beer as a complex mixture allows the students to learn how to directly apply their chemistry knowledge which results in them obtaining correct answers for their chemistry classes. They also gained powerful arguments in class discussions and were able to judge and make proper health and life choices for themselves.</p>

								<p>	Beer Market Expected to Reach USD 989.48 Billion by 2028</p>
								<p>Historically, alcohol has been used in social engagements and the trend is still growing. The rising prevalence of alcohol socializations and growing westernisation among consumers are predicted to augment the growth of the market in the coming years.

									The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the market growth of the beer industry negatively due to the shutdown of bars and restaurants worldwide. Additionally, the closure of manufacturing facilities has affected the industry. The disruptions in global supply chain networks have further aggravated the situation. Nonetheless, the demand for the product has expanded swiftly in 2021 due to the direct-to-consumer channel. Online beer sales also increased during the pandemic. These trends are likely to amplify the market growth in future.</p>

								<p>The state of beer media</p>
								<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the trends in craft beer during 2020 and that included the media coverage of craft brewing. Online publications trended towards subscription-based platforms. Regional print beer publications, dependent upon advertising and free distribution, all but disappeared. A new way of delivering content to craft beer lovers, meanwhile, emerged in the form of virtual festivals.

									In the past, print magazines were often a major conduit for linking consumers and brewers to their lucrative beer festivals, a model pursued by All About Beer which hosted World Beer Festivals, and BeerAdvocate which hosted more than 70 ticketed events prior to the pandemic.
									
									Currently, there is a shift towards premium paid subscriptions for more thoughtful online media content as exhibited by the publications of Brewbound, Craft Beer & Brewing and The Beer Connoisseur. The online publications provide readers with exclusive information and reviews of craft beers which would invoke the interests of many who enjoy the consumption of it.

								<p>Some studies have shown an association between moderate alcohol intake and a lower risk of dying from heart disease. This includes heart attacks, strokes, heart failures, coronary heart diseases and the “hardening of the arteries” (atherosclerosis)

									In a study published in the National Library of Medicine, researchers from Spain found that a compound in hops potentially protects brain cells, thereby defending against mental health disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. 
									
									Furthermore, there was a discovery of antibiotics in the history of beer whereby Ancient Nubians extracted Tetracycline - an antibiotic from the leftovers of brewing beer as medicine. The bacteria had been mixed with grains that were used for brewing resulting in the bacteria brewing antibiotics to fight other microbes, forming the Tetracycline that has powerful bacteria-killing properties and is widely used today. </p>

								<p>Cybersecurity on beverage company</p>
								<p>As the beer manufacturing industry becomes increasingly computer-driven, using internet network technologies, this opens up opportunities for cybercriminals to hack into their systems to steal valuable digital IP or manipulate controls for ransom. 

									As manufacturing has become increasing computer-driven, Information technology and Operational Technology networks have become interconnected, enabling cybercriminals to use IT systems as backdoors into OT networks, spreading across internal networks more easily.
									
									Therefore, enhancing security and developing a strong line of defence in the beer industry especially in production facilities has become extremely crucial to prevent cyberattacks that will severely disrupt its operations.

								<p>War&#39;s influence on Beer Trends</p>
								<p>Beer was used to keep soldier&#39;s content by providing them with temporary relief from the terrors of battle. It was also used as different means to boost their morale during war.</p>
								<p>Due to high demand for beer for soldiers that were away fighting war in 1945, ingredients had to be rationed as they were short in supply. This produced lighter, less flavourful lagers which led to the rise of bland and weak beer as the norm for military rations and mostly caused the general shift in taste towards mild beers. 

									Subsequently, baby boomers became more demanding and flavourful beers grew traction with craft beer
